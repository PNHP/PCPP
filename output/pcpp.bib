	abstract = {Recent estimates indicate that one-fifth of botanical species worldwide are considered at risk of becoming extinct in the wild. One available strategy for conserving many rare plant species is reintroduction, which holds much promise especially when carefully planned by following guidelines and when monitored long-term. We review the Center for Plant Conservation Best Reintroduction Practice Guidelines and highlight important components for planning plant reintroductions. Before attempting reintroductions practitioners should justify them, should consider alternative conservation strategies, understand threats, and ensure that these threats are absent from any recipient site. Planning a reintroduction requires considering legal and logistic parameters as well as target species and recipient site attributes. Carefully selecting the genetic composition of founders, founder population size, and recipient site will influence establishment and population growth. Whenever possible practitioners should conduct reintroductions as experiments and publish results. To document whether populations are sustainable will require long-term monitoring for decades, therefore planning an appropriate monitoring technique for the taxon must consider current and future needs. Botanical gardens can play a leading role in developing the science and practice of plant reintroduction.},

	abstract = {Despite the massive efforts that have been made to conserve plant diversity across the world during the past few decades, it is becoming increasingly evident that our current strategies are not sufficiently effective to prevent the continuing decline in biodiversity. As a recent report by the CBD indicates, current progress and commitments are insufficient to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets by 2020. Threatened species lists continue to grow while the world's governments fail to meet biodiversity conservation goals. Clearly, we are failing in our attempts to conserve biodiversity on a sufficient scale. The reasons for this situation are complex, including scientific, technical, sociological, economic and political factors. The conservation community is divided about how to respond. Some believe that saving all existing biodiversity is still an achievable goal. On the other hand, there are those who believe that we need to accept that biodiversity will inevitably continue to be lost, despite all our conservation actions and that we must focus on what to save, why and where. It has also been suggested that we need a new approach to conservation in the face of the challenges posed by the Anthropocene biosphere which we now inhabit. Whatever view one holds on the above issues, it is clear that we need to review the effectiveness of our current conservation strategies, identify the limiting factors that are preventing the Aichi goals being met and at the same time take whatever steps are necessary to make our conservation protocols more explicit, operational and efficient so as to achieve the maximum conservation effect. This paper addresses the key issues that underlie our failure to meet agreed targets and discusses the necessary changes to our conservation approaches. While we can justifiably be proud of our many achievements and successes in plant conservation in the past 30 years, which have helped slow the rate of loss, unless we devise a more coherent, consistent and integrated global strategy in which both the effectiveness and limitations of our current policies, action plans and procedures are recognized, and reflect this in national strategies, and then embark on a much bolder and ambitious set of actions, progress will be limited and plant diversity will continue to decline.},

	url = {http://www.natureserve.org/conservation-tools/standards-methods/natureserve-core-methodology},
	abstract = {Property field\_lead Use of a standard methodology is the defining characteristic of the NatureServe network. By specifying standard procedures for gathering, managing, and representing data for species and ecological systems, the core methodology unites the efforts of individuals and institutions throughout the Western Hemisphere to advance the knowledge needed for effective biodiversity conservation. While it has evolved to keep pace with scientific and technological advances, the basic continuity of the methodology over more than 40 years has permitted the network to accumulate vast amounts of authoritative data that is comparable over the full range of a species or ecological system.View NatureServe's Core Standards and Methods documentation.Why Core Methodology?Data from a single jurisdiction paints only part of the picture about most species and ecological communities. The use of standard definitions, methods, and practices by a network of locally operated programs in the United States, Canada, and Latin America allows NatureServe to combine biodiversity data sets across jurisdictional boundaries. The consolidated data and its value-added products can be utilized to evaluate range-wide conservation status and trends, and guide management and research activities at multiple geographic scales.Features \& BenefitsNatureServe methodology is characterized by four basic principles:It is scientifically and empirically based.It provides a common vocabulary and standard procedures, allowing ideas and information to be shared throughout the network.It supports the collection and management of data at multiple geographic scales, allowing decisions to be made based on detailed local information, yet within a global context.It is dynamic and evolves to meet new scientific needs and technological advances.Because biodiversity encompasses the variety of life at all levels, the methodology is designed to deal with both species and ecological communities, referred to collectively as "elements of biodiversity." The NatureServe network has gathered and organized data on over 100,000 such elements of biodiversity, including animals, plants, fungi, and terrestrial and freshwater communities. Scientific names, local and global conservation status, basic biological and ecological characteristics, management requirements, and the location and condition of species populations and community occurrences are among the types of data collected.The data centers that make up the NatureServe network utilize the core methodology to answer the following key questions: What species and ecosystems exist? Where are they? How are they doing (their condition and status, and priority for conservation)? What should we do (conservation action)? How are we doing (evaluating success)? Data centers may need to adapt aspects of this methodology to meet local needs or comply with institutional requirements, but by and large all the data centers "play by the same rulebook"—allowing them to operate as a network.Ever since its inception in the mid-1970s, the methodology has been reflected in computerized data management systems. NatureServe continues to develop custom software applications that incorporate the core methodology standards and allow local datasets to be compiled and compared across jurisdictional boundaries—this data management system is known as Biotics 5.Core Methodology Training (CMT)Core Methodology Training, or CMT, is a hands-on introduction to standards, methods, and tools that are "core" to the success of the NatureServe Network. The training supports an understanding of NatureServe data and the standards and methods that support its development. In addition, CMT facilitates skillful evaluation and application of species and ecosystem data to guide conservation decision-making. Should I Attend?We recommend attending CMT if you are a recent addition to the NatureServe Network, have never taken methodology training before, took methodology training many years ago, or are a partner organization working with the NatureServe network and/or using NatureServe data, and want to learn more about the methods used to guide the development and use of our data. Since NatureServe methodologies are always evolving and the training has evolved to be more hand-on and interactive, most NatureServe Network staff, members, and partners will benefit from attending this training.What Past Attendees Are SayingI really enjoyed the training! It gave me a sense of why I chose this job and a bigger picture of the NatureServe community and how it benefits species and habitat conservation. I think everyone in this field should attend the training at least once so they can appreciate and understand the standardized, science-based methodology that NatureServe offers to programs on an international scale.-Stephanie Shelton, Texas Parks and Wildlife DepartmentNext Core Methodology Training (CMT) EventDates: April 24-27, 2018 (CMT will be held from 9am-5pm on Tuesday-Thursday, and wrap up at noon on Friday)Location: Colorado State University, Fort Collins, ColoradoTrainers: From NatureServe trainers include: Don Faber-Langendoen (lead trainer), Whitney Weber, and Shara Howie.

	abstract = {A 41-year study (1968–2008) of the orchids of the Catoctin Mountains, Frederick County, Maryland reveals that 19 of 21 species have experienced precipitous declines. Four of these species are currently considered Threatened or Endangered by the State of Maryland and another two are considered Rare. Annual census data at 167 sites from throughout the Catoctin Mountains on protected and unprotected lands (private and public) show a loss of three species from the study area, a decline of {\textgreater}90 \% (ranging from 99 to 91 \%) in seven species, and a decline of {\textless}90 \% (ranging from 51 to 87 \%) for nine species. Each species was analyzed using Ordinary Least Squares Analysis to show trends and document corresponding R2 and p values. We tested the hypothesis that this decline is due to intensified herbivory by white-tailed deer. The overall orchid census data is significantly inversely-correlated (R = −0.93) to the white-tailed deer harvest data of Frederick County (a surrogate for population size), which includes the entirety of the study area. Platanthera ciliaris showed a huge expansion at a single site explicitly managed for this species otherwise this orchid showed a decline similar to the other species. Proper management is critical for the continuation of the orchid species in this study, be it control of the white-tailed deer herd or combating woody plant succession in the case of P. ciliaris.},

	abstract = {:   Bunnell et al. (2009) introduced the concept of Stewardship Responsibility (SR) rankings as a tool for conservation planning, using global rankings of rare species in British Columbia. I applied a version of their tool to assess biodiversity distributions in New York State Parks, using records collected by the N.Y. Natural Heritage Program. Comprehensive surveys were conducted among 150 parks over a decade, leading to a database of 1074 records for 312 rare species and 98 significant ecological communities. I applied SR ranks in a nested design — agency-wide — among regions within the agency and across the state (comparisons with other management entities). Subsets of parks and regions ranked more highly than others, but most parks contain at least one rare species and significant ecological community, indicating a broad distribution of important biological resources. Statewide, the agency maintains a very high SR rank profile in proportion to its land area ({\textless} 1\% of the state), with 43\% of all New York rare species found in at least one State Park, and 30 species fully or primarily dependent on the agency for their protection. Taking this information a step further, I developed a set of park-by-park Natural Heritage Biodiversity Profiles, which emphasize unique contributions of each park in ways designed to inform the general public. Although many state and provincial park systems emphasize their recreational features, probably all make critical contributions to biodiversity conservation, and tools like these can be used to illustrate and enhance those contributions.},

Range changes are also used to guide conservation management decisions. Although changes in geographic range may provide information relevant to conservation decisions, many factors affect estimates of geographic range. We investigated how geographic range change is estimated and used in the listing process. We evaluated all terrestrial vertebrates in Canada whose assessment as threatened or endangered was based at least partially on small range or range reduction. The 39 cases of birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians (including 2 populations of 1 species) used a variety of historical and recent data, including natural history archives, special surveys, and standardized surveys. Little mention was made in the reports of the methods used for range delineation or the limitations of geographic range maps. Of the 39 cases listed by the reports as being threatened or endangered in Canada at least in part due to geographic range, 32 (82\%) had ≤10\% of their current global range in Canada (i.e., most had wide ranges in the United States), resulting in the listing of species with marginal and sometimes nonviable populations within Canada even when the global population was not at risk. We identify several ways that listing decisions could be improved. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Agencies and individuals responsible for the conservation of species within given boundaries may deprioritize the conservation of species that are rare within those boundaries if the species’ range is extensive (e.g., such as when populations occur at the edges of a species’ geographic range). We overlapped amphibian and reptile geographic ranges with state boundaries in the United States to show that many of the species within any given state could be considered peripheral and are therefore vulnerable to conservation inaction based on that fact alone. We argue that a species’ overall geographic range should not be used as a primary reason for deprioritizing the conservation of a species within a given boundary, and illustrate that even populations at the edges of a species’ range have value to the overall conservation of that species and are integral parts of ecological communities wherever they occur. We urge decision makers and biologists to consider these arguments during ranking processes, and not reflexively deprioritize the conservation of species at the edges of their geographic ranges. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Key steps in improving allocation of conservation resources are establishing specific goals to guide conservation efforts, ensuring that those goals address the challenges of jurisdictional rarity, and creating tools that can assign species quickly to appropriate actions and rank species or ecosystems for conservation effort. We describe goals for conservation that assist resource allocation within jurisdictions and two tools to help the process. One tool sorts species into practical groups for conservation action. It creates groups of species requiring similar actions. The other tool assigns conservation priorities. It orders species or ecosystems based on criteria governing risk, modified by feasibility, stewardship responsibility, disjunctiveness, and pattern of range collapse. Priorities can be ordered within an action group, within a goal, or as an overall rank. Results of applying the approach are illustrated using examples from British Columbia.},

	abstract = {Conservation planning decisions are typically made on the basis of species distribution or occurrence data, which ideally would have complete spatial and taxonomic coverage. Agencies are constrained in the data they can collect, often pragmatically prioritising certain groups such as threatened species, or methods, such as volunteer surveys. This mismatch between goals and realities inevitably leads to bias and uncertainty in conservation planning outputs, yet few studies have assessed how data realities affect planning outputs. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the Protection Index, a method for assessing conservation progress and priorities, using an extensive dataset on species occurrences and distributions derived from the Florida Natural Areas Inventory. Analyses revealed a high proportion of occurrence records for threatened species and certain taxonomic groups, reflecting the agencies’ priorities. We performed a sensitivity analysis on conservation planning outputs, simulating a ‘data poor’ scenario typical of many real situations; we deleted increasing amounts of data in both a biased (exaggerating patterns observed) and unbiased (random) manner. We assessed the effects of data paucity and bias on the value of potential conservation sites, and planning priorities. Certain high value sites with only a few important species occurrences were more sensitive to data depletion than those with many occurrences. Data bias based on taxonomic bias was more influential to site value than threat rank. To maximise benefit from surveys from a planning perspective, it would be better to focus on poorly surveyed areas rather than adding occurrences in already well represented sites. This study demonstrates the importance of sensitivity analysis in conservation planning, and that the effects of uncertainty and data quality on planning decisions should not be ignored.},
